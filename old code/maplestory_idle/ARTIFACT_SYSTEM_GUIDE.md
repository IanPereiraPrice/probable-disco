# Active Effect Scaling (linear)
effect_at_star = base_effect + (star * per_star_bonus)

# Book of Ancient CD Bonus
bonus_cd = your_crit_rate * conversion_rate
# Example at ★1: 111.9% * 0.36 = 40.3% CD

# Hexagon Necklace Multiplier
hex_multiplier = 1 + (3 * damage_per_stack)
# Example at ★3: 1 + (3 * 0.26) = 1.78

# Expected Rolls for Target
expected_rolls = 1 / probability
# For 2 slots: probability = 1 - (1 - p)^2
# For 3 slots: probability = 1 - (1 - p)^3
