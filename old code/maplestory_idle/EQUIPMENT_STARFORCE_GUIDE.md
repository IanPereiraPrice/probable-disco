# STARFORCE ENHANCEMENT SYSTEM

## Overview

Starforce increases equipment stats by applying percentage multipliers.
- Each successful enhancement adds 1 star (★)
- Maximum: 25 stars
- Stats multiply based on Main/Sub Option Amplify

### Core Formula

```
Final Stat = Base Stat × (1 + Main Option Amplify%)
Final Sub Stat = Base Sub Stat × (1 + Sub Option Amplify%)
```

**Example:** Base Attack 3,000 at ★16 (350% Main Amplify)
```
Final Attack = 3,000 × (1 + 3.50) = 3,000 × 4.50 = 13,500
```

## RISK ZONES

### Safe Zone (★0-12)
- No decrease or destruction chance
- Success rate: 100% → 33%
- **Recommendation:** Always push to ★10-12 minimum

### Decrease Zone (★13-14)
- **12% decrease chance** introduced
- Can lose stars on failed enhancement
- No destruction yet

### Destruction Zone (★15+)
- **3%+ destruction chance** starts at ★15→16
- Destruction chance increases each stage
- **USE PROTECTION SCROLLS**

---

## PROTECTION OPTIONS

### Decrease Mitigation
- **Cost:** +100% of base meso cost (+100% scrolls)
- **Effect:** Sets Decrease chance to **0%** (adds that % to Maintained)
- **When:** At stages 13-14 and 16+ (anywhere with Decrease chance)

### Destruction Mitigation
- **Cost:** +100% of base meso cost (+100% scrolls)
- **Effect:** **Halves** destruction chance (e.g., 6% → 3%)
- **When:** At ★15+ where destruction exists

### Both Protections
- **Cost:** +200% of base meso cost (+200% scrolls) = **3× total cost**
- **Effect:** No decrease + halved destruction
- **Example:** 17→18 with both = 330,000 × 3 = 990,000 meso, 17 × 3 = 51 scrolls
- **When:** On irreplaceable equipment at ★16+

### Mitigation Example (17→18)
| Option | Meso | Scrolls | Decrease | Destroy |
|--------|------|---------|----------|---------|
| No mitigation | 330,000 | 17 | 15% | 6% |
| Decrease only | 660,000 | 34 | **0%** | 6% |
| Destroy only | 660,000 | 34 | 15% | **3%** |
| Both | 990,000 | 51 | **0%** | **3%** |

---

## EXPECTED COSTS

### To ★10 (Safe)
| Resource | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Meso | ~1,000,000 |
| Scrolls | ~45 |
| Attempts | ~15-20 |

### To ★15 (Medium Risk)
| Resource | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Meso | ~3,500,000 |
| Scrolls | ~105 |
| Attempts | Variable |

### To ★20 (High Risk)
| Resource | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Meso | ~8,500,000+ | Highly variable |
| Scrolls | ~205+ | More with bad luck |
| Protection | Essential | At ★16+ |

---

## REVERSE CALCULATION

To find base stats from enhanced stats:

```
Base Stat = Final Stat ÷ (1 + Main Amplify%)
Base Sub Stat = Final Sub Stat ÷ (1 + Sub Amplify%)
```

### Quick Reference

| Stars | Main Divisor | Sub Divisor |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| ★16 | ÷ 4.50 | ÷ 1.60 |
| ★17 | ÷ 5.00 | ÷ 1.70 |
| ★18 | ÷ 5.50 | ÷ 1.80 |
| ★19 | ÷ 6.00 | ÷ 1.90 |
| ★20 | ÷ 7.00 | ÷ 2.00 |
| ★21 | ÷ 8.00 | ÷ 2.10 |
| ★22 | ÷ 10.00 | ÷ 2.30 |
| ★23 | ÷ 13.00 | ÷ 2.60 |
| ★24 | ÷ 16.00 | ÷ 3.00 |
| ★25 | ÷ 21.00 | ÷ 3.50 |

**Example:** Necklace shows 68.5% Damage at ★19
```
Base Damage % = 68.5% ÷ 1.90 = 36.1%
```

## DAMAGE % SCALING WITH STARFORCE

This is why Ring/Necklace are so valuable!

| Item | Stars | Base Dmg % | SF Bonus | Total Dmg % |
|------|-------|------------|----------|-------------|
| Squashy Ring | ★18 | 10.2% | +8.1% | 18.3% |
| Cracked Necklace | ★19 | 36.1% | +32.4% | 68.5% |

**At high stars, Damage % nearly DOUBLES from Sub Amplify!**

# SCROLL ENHANCEMENT SYSTEM

## Overview

Scrolls add flat stats to equipment through a 10-slot system.

### Scroll Mechanics
- 10 slots per equipment
- Slot 5 has +10% success bonus
- Slot 10 has +20% success bonus
- Reset costs 50 Spell Trace (resets ALL slots)
- Can save/restore scroll results

### Best Scroll (with Guild Bonus)

**Level 85 (15%) Scroll:**
- Base Success: 15% → 20% with guild
- Stats per success: +800 ATK, +4,000 HP, **+0.8% Damage Amp**
- Cost: 800 Spell Trace

### Slot Success Rates (with 5% Guild)

| Slot | Success Rate |
|------|--------------|
| 1-4 | 20% |
| 5 | 30% (+10% bonus) |
| 6-9 | 20% |
| 10 | 40% (+20% bonus) |

### Expected Results (One Pass)

```
Expected Successes = (8 × 0.20) + (1 × 0.30) + (1 × 0.40) = 2.3 per equipment
Cost per equipment = 10 slots × 800 ST = 8,000 Spell Trace
Expected Damage Amp = 2.3 × 0.8% = 1.84%
```

|--------|-------------------------|----------|
| Starforce 1-10 | 1,500-3,000 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Equipment Potential | 1,000-2,000 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

---

## Key Insights

1. **Ring/Necklace are the most valuable slots** - Damage % scales with SF
2. **★10 is mandatory** - Safe, cheap, huge value (2.5× stats)
3. **Use protection at ★16+** - Destruction is real
4. **Scrolls are separate** - Damage Amp is its own multiplier
5. **Tier + Rarity both matter** - Epic T1 < Unique T4
6. **Base stats have variance** - Can low-roll or high-roll

---

## Formulas Reference

```python
# Starforce Amplification
final_main_stat = base_main_stat * (1 + main_amplify_percent)
final_sub_stat = base_sub_stat * (1 + sub_amplify_percent)

# Reverse Calculation
base_stat = total_stat / (1 + amplify_percent)

# Expected Scroll Successes
expected = (8 * 0.20) + (1 * 0.30) + (1 * 0.40)  # = 2.3

# Tier Multiplier
tier_multiplier = 1.15 ** (4 - tier)  # T1=1.52, T2=1.32, T3=1.15, T4=1.0

# Rarity Multiplier (vs Epic)
# Unique ~2x, Legendary ~3.4x, Mythic ~5x
```
