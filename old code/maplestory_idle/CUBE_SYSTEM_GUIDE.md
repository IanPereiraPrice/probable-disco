# EQUIPMENT POTENTIAL CUBE SYSTEM

## Last Updated: December 2025

---

## OVERVIEW

The potential system adds bonus stats to equipment through 3 potential slots. There are two types:
- **Regular Potential** - Primary potential lines
- **Bonus Potential** - Secondary potential lines (separate system, same mechanics)

Each potential slot can roll stats from different tiers, with a separate pity system guaranteeing tier-ups after a certain number of cubes.

---

## CUBE TYPES

### Regular Potential Cube
- Rerolls all 3 Regular Potential lines
- Chance to tier up the potential
- Has its own pity counter

### Bonus Potential Cube  
- Rerolls all 3 Bonus Potential lines
- Chance to tier up the bonus potential
- Has its own (higher) pity counter

**Important:** You cannot mix and match - all 3 lines reroll together, and you must accept ALL new lines or keep ALL old lines.

## TIER UP PROBABILITIES

| Current Tier | Next Tier | Probability |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Normal | Rare | 6.00% |
| Rare | Epic | 3.333% |
| Epic | Unique | 0.60% |
| Unique | Legendary | 0.21% |
| Legendary | Mystic | ~0.14% (estimated) |

**Note:** These are the natural tier-up rates per cube use.

---

## PITY SYSTEM (GUARANTEED TIER UP)

After a certain number of cubes without tier-up, you are **guaranteed** to tier up.

### Regular Potential Cube Pity

| From Tier | To Tier | Pity Threshold |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Normal | Rare | 33 cubes |
| Rare | Epic | ~60 cubes (estimated) |
| Epic | Unique | 150 cubes |
| Unique | Legendary | 333 cubes |
| Legendary | Mystic | 714 cubes |

### Bonus Potential Cube Pity

| From Tier | To Tier | Pity Threshold |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Normal | Rare | 45 cubes |
| Rare | Epic | ~85 cubes (estimated) |
| Epic | Unique | 150 cubes |
| Unique | Legendary | 417 cubes |
| Legendary | Mystic | 714 cubes |

**Key Insight:** Bonus potential has higher pity thresholds than regular (except Legendary→Mystic which is the same).

---

## SLOT COLOR SYSTEM (YELLOW vs GREY)

Each potential slot has a chance to be "Yellow" (current tier) or "Grey" (previous tier stats).

### Slot Color Probabilities

| Slot | Yellow (Current Tier) | Grey (Previous Tier) |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Slot 1 | 100% | 0% |
| Slot 2 | 24% | 76% |
| Slot 3 | 8% | 92% |

**Critical Insight:** 
- **Slot 1 is ALWAYS current tier** - focus optimization here
- Slots 2 & 3 will usually be grey (lower tier stats)
- This means Slot 1 is ~10× more valuable than Slots 2/3

## SPECIAL POTENTIALS

Special potentials have a **1% chance** to appear on ANY slot, but are subject to the same yellow/grey split.

### Special Potential by Slot

| Equipment | Special Stat | Values by Tier |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Gloves** | Critical Damage | 20% (U) / 30% (L) / 50% (M) |
| **Shoulder** | Defense Penetration | 8% (U) / 12% (L) / 20% (M) |
| **Ring** | All Skills Level | +5 (E) / +8 (U) / +12 (L) / +16 (M) |
| **Necklace** | All Skills Level | +5 (E) / +8 (U) / +12 (L) / +16 (M) |
| **Cape** | Final Attack Damage | 3% (E) / 5% (U) / 8% (L) / 12% (M) |
| **Bottom** | Final Attack Damage | 3% (E) / 5% (U) / 8% (L) / 12% (M) |

### Special Potential Probabilities

**For Slot 1 (100% yellow):**
- 1% chance = 1 in 100 cubes to see special

**For Slot 2 (24% yellow):**
- 1% × 24% = 0.24% chance = 1 in ~417 cubes

**For Slot 3 (8% yellow):**
- 1% × 8% = 0.08% chance = 1 in ~1,250 cubes

**Priority:** Always target Slot 1 for special potentials!

---

## VALUABLE VS USELESS STATS

### Tier S (Best) - Worth Cubing For
- **Damage %** - Direct damage multiplier
- **Main Stat %** - DEX%/STR%/INT%/LUK% depending on class
- **Critical Damage %** (Special on Gloves)
- **Final Damage %** (Special on Bottom/Cape)
- **Defense Penetration %** (Special on Shoulder)
- **All Skills Level** (Special on Ring/Necklace)

### Tier A (Good)
- **Max Damage Multiplier** - Useful damage stat
- **Min Damage Multiplier** - Stabilizes damage
- **Critical Rate** - If under cap

### Tier B (Situational)
- **Attack Speed** - Only if you need it
- **Skill Cooldown** - Depends on build

### Tier F (Useless)
- **Defense %** - Minimal value
- **Max HP %** - Minimal value
- **Max MP %** - Worthless
- **Flat Main Stat** - Much worse than %
- **Wrong Main Stat** (e.g., INT% on Bowmaster)

## EXPECTED CUBES TO REACH TARGETS

### To Tier Up (Natural + Pity Combined)

| Tier Up | Natural Expected | Pity Guarantee | Realistic Expected |
|---------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Normal → Rare | 17 cubes | 33 cubes | ~15 cubes |
| Rare → Epic | 30 cubes | 60 cubes | ~25 cubes |
| Epic → Unique | 167 cubes | 150 cubes | **150 cubes (pity)** |
| Unique → Legendary | 476 cubes | 333 cubes | **333 cubes (pity)** |
| Legendary → Mystic | 714 cubes | 714 cubes | 714 cubes |

**Key Insight:** For Epic+ tiers, you'll likely hit pity before natural tier-up.

### To Hit Specific Stat on Slot 1

| Target | Probability | Expected Cubes |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Any Damage % (current tier) | 4% | 25 cubes |
| Any Main Stat % (current tier) | 4.5% | ~22 cubes |
| Any Special (current tier) | 1% | 100 cubes |
| Specific Special (e.g., CD on Gloves) | 1% | 100 cubes |

---

## COST EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS

### Cost to Guarantee Legendary (from Unique)

**Regular Potential:**
- Pity: 333 cubes
- Cost: 333 × 600 💎 = **199,800 💎** (monthly package rate)
- Or: 333 × 3,000 💎 = **999,000 💎** (normal shop rate)

**Bonus Potential:**
- Pity: 417 cubes  
- Cost: 417 × 1,200 💎 = **500,400 💎** (monthly package rate)

### Cost to Guarantee Mystic (from Legendary)

**Both Regular and Bonus:**
- Pity: 714 cubes
- Regular Cost: 714 × 600 💎 = **428,400 💎** (best rate)
- Bonus Cost: 714 × 1,200 💎 = **856,800 💎** (best rate)

## OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### Priority Order for Cubing

1. **Fix Bad Slot 1 Lines First**
   - Wrong main stat (e.g., LUK% on Bowmaster)
   - Completely useless stat (Defense%, Max MP%)
   - Cost: Low (just need any improvement)

2. **Target Good Stats on Slot 1**
   - Aim for Damage % or Main Stat %
   - Accept "good enough" (any damage stat)
   - Cost: Medium (~25-50 cubes)

3. **Chase Special Potentials**
   - Only on priority slots (Gloves, Ring, Necklace)
   - Budget 100+ cubes
   - Cost: High (100+ cubes, may take much more)

4. **Tier Up to Legendary**
   - Only after Slot 1 is acceptable
   - Budget for pity (333 cubes regular, 417 bonus)
   - Cost: Very High

5. **Tier Up to Mystic**
   - Whale territory
   - 714 cubes guaranteed
   - Cost: Extremely High (400k+ 💎)

### When to Stop Cubing

- **Stop immediately** if you hit a special potential
- **Stop** when Slot 1 has good stat at current tier
- **Stop** when you've spent your budget
- **Don't chase** perfect Slots 2/3 (76%/92% grey anyway)

### Budget Recommendations

| Goal | Budget | Expected Outcome |
|------|--------|------------------|
| Fix trash Slot 1 | 10-20 cubes | ~80% chance improvement |
| Get good Slot 1 stat | 50 cubes | ~85% chance of Damage% or Main% |
| Hunt special on Slot 1 | 100 cubes | ~63% chance to see special |
| Tier to Legendary | 333 cubes | 100% guaranteed (pity) |
| Tier to Mystic | 714 cubes | 100% guaranteed (pity) |

---

## PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Trash Unique Equipment
**Current:** Slot 1 = 9% Max MP (useless)
**Goal:** Any useful stat
**Strategy:** Cube until any damage stat appears
**Expected:** 2-5 cubes (very fast)
**Verdict:** ALWAYS cube trash potentials

### Example 2: Decent Unique Equipment  
**Current:** Slot 1 = 9% DEX (good)
**Goal:** Tier up to Legendary
**Strategy:** Save 333 cubes, then commit
**Expected:** Hit pity at 333 cubes
**Verdict:** Only if you have the budget

### Example 3: Gloves Chasing Crit Damage Special
**Current:** Legendary, Slot 1 = 12% DEX
**Goal:** Crit Damage special (50% at Mystic!)
**Strategy:** Budget 100 cubes, accept if you see special
**Expected:** 63% to see special in 100 cubes
**Verdict:** High risk/high reward, only if you can afford to lose current line

---

## KEY FORMULAS

### Probability to NOT hit in N cubes
```
P(no hit) = (1 - p)^N
```

### Probability to hit AT LEAST ONCE in N cubes
```
P(at least one) = 1 - (1 - p)^N
```

### Expected cubes to hit (natural)
```
Expected = 1 / p
```

### Expected cubes to hit (with pity)
```
If pity < natural_expected:
    Expected = pity
Else:
    Expected ≈ natural_expected × 0.9  (pity acts as safety net)
```

---

## REMEMBER

1. **Slot 1 is ALWAYS current tier** - prioritize Slot 1 optimization
2. **Slots 2/3 are mostly grey** - don't overspend trying to fix them
3. **Pity is SHARED across equipment** - counter resets on tier-up only
4. **You can't mix old and new** - must accept all 3 lines or keep all 3
5. **Special potentials are rare** - 1% base, but powerful
6. **Higher tiers = better values** - same stat but bigger numbers
7. **Cost scales exponentially** - budget carefully for high tiers
