# MAPLESTORY M - COMPANION SYSTEM GUIDE

## Last Updated: December 29, 2025

## OVERVIEW

Companions are collectible characters that provide stat bonuses through two mechanisms:

1. **On-Equip Effects** - Only active when the companion is equipped in a slot
2. **Inventory Effects** - ALWAYS active, regardless of whether equipped

You can equip **7 companions** at a time (1 Main + 6 Sub slots).

## COMPANION TIERS BY JOB ADVANCEMENT

| Job Tier | Inventory Effect Type | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| **2nd Job** | Flat Main Stat (DEX/STR/INT/LUK) | Always active |
| **3rd Job** | Damage % | Always active |
| **4th Job** | Damage % | Always active, higher values |

**Key Insight:** ALL inventory effects are always active. You don't need to equip companions for their inventory effects - only for on-equip effects.

## COMPANION ACQUISITION

### How to Obtain Companions

1. **Companion Gacha** - Main source
2. **Events** - Limited time rewards
3. **Achievements** - Certain milestones
4. **Guild Shop** - Exchange currency

### Unlock Order

- 2nd Job companions unlock first
- 3rd Job companions unlock at higher account progression
- 4th Job companions are the rarest/latest

---

## COMPANION vs DEX FORMULA INTERACTION

### Test Evidence (from project knowledge)

```
Companion +19 flat DEX → +43 Total DEX (multiplier 2.26x) ✓
```

This confirms that companion flat DEX is part of the **Flat DEX Pool** and gets multiplied by your %DEX:

```
Total_DEX = Flat_DEX_Pool × (1 + %DEX)
```

With 126.5% DEX bonus:
- 2,658 flat DEX from companions → 2,658 × 2.265 = **6,020 effective DEX**

---

## OPTIMIZATION PRIORITY

### For Inventory Effects (Always Active)

1. **Unlock all companions** - Each one adds permanent stats
2. **Level 4th Job first** - Highest Damage % per level
3. **Level 3rd Job second** - Good Damage % scaling
4. **Level 2nd Job last** - Flat DEX is lower priority than Damage %

### For On-Equip Effects

1. **ATK SPD companions** - Critical for stage clearing speed
2. **Min/Max Damage** - Good general damage boost
3. **Boss/Normal Damage** - Situational based on content
